# J-Phone

J-Phone is a mobile application written in React Native. J-Phone calls you and records 60 seconds of what you have to say. This creates a quick and frictionless process to speed up the time it takes to journal. The urgency of a call allows you to never forget to journal so that you don't miss out on the benefits it has to offer.
